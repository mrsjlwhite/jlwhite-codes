                Iâ€™m a self-taught software engineer with a passion for developing user-friendly web applications. Since
                beginning my
                career in 2017, my interest and admiration for programming has only grown. During this time, Iâ€™ve
                developed an
                ethic
                of building clean, scalable, and well-organized code. I am interested in solo work and collaborative
                projects.
