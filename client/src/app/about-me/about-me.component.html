                I’m a self-taught software engineer with a passion for developing user-friendly web applications. Since
                beginning my
                career in 2017, my interest and admiration for programming has only grown. During this time, I’ve
                developed an
                ethic
                of building clean, scalable, and well-organized code. I am interested in solo work and collaborative
                projects.
